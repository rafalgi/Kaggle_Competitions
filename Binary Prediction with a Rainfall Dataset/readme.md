# Binary Prediction with a Rainfall Dataset

This project aims to predict the 'rainfall' target feature values (binary: 0 = no rain, 1 = rain) for each day of the year and maximize AUC-ROC by selecting meaningful features, experimenting with different models, and optimizing hyperparameters.

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to predict whether it will rain on a given day using historical weather data. The prediction is binary, indicating either rain (1) or no rain (0).

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project has been synthetically generated from a deep learning model trained on the Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning dataset.

## Goals and Objectives
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to analyze trends, visualize distributions, and handle missing values.
- Build and compare machine learning models for rainfall prediction.
- Optimize hyperparameters for improved accuracy.
- Generate and submit predictions to Kaggle.

## Methodology

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyze trends and visualize distributions of features.
- Handle missing values in the dataset.

### Data Cleaning
- Remove unnecessary columns.
- Fill missing values using appropriate imputation methods.

### Feature Engineering
- Select and engineer features that contribute to the prediction of rainfall.

### Model Building and Evaluation
- Train and evaluate different classification models for rainfall prediction.
- Compare models based on their performance metrics.

### Hyperparameter Optimization
- Fine-tune models to improve their accuracy using hyperparameter optimization techniques.

### Prediction and Submission
- Generate probability predictions using the best model.
- Submit predictions to Kaggle for evaluation.

## Results
- The evaluation metric used is AUC-ROC.
- AUC (Area Under the Curve) measures how well a model differentiates between positive and negative classes.
- A higher AUC indicates a better model.

## Conclusion
Summarize the findings and performance of the models used in the project.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, tensorflow
